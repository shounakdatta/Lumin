# Lumin
Virtual Form Assistant

In recent times, there has been a drastic increase in the number of online forms. However, with increasing complexity seen everyday, very few of these applications provide user-specific support. Lumin is an intelligent virtual assistant that allows for web developers to provide users detailed, real-time support with online forms. Lumin's library consists of a CSS and JS file that provides all of its functionality. In the attached project, you will also find an example online form where Lumin's features have been implemented. In the near future, this application can be transformed into a browser plugin so that Lumin can be used regardless of whether the developer chose to add the library or not.
